# READS QUALITY
# Filter long reads with Chopper
chopper_headcrop: 0 # Trim N nucleotides from the start of a read [default: 0]

# MAPPING
# Mapping on the reference genome with Minimap2
minimap_ax: map-hifi # Preset for the sequencing technology (see Minimap2 manual)
minimap_seed: 42 # Integer seed for randomizing equally best hits. Minimap2 hashes INT and read name when choosing between equally best hits.

# Mapping on the reference genome with NGMLR
min-identity: 0.65 # Alignments with an identity lower than this threshold will be discarded [0.65]
# min-residues: 0.25 # Alignments containing less than <int> or (<float> * read length) residues will be discarded [0.25]
# no-smallinv: 'false' # Don't detect small inversions [false]
# no-lowqualitysplit: 'false' #Split alignments with poor quality [false]


# SV CALLING
# Common settings
min_coverage: 10 # minimum of coverage for the SV callers
min_sv_size: 30 # minimum SV length to detect

# Sniffles2 specific
minsupport: "auto" #  Minimum number of supporting reads for a SV to be reported (default: automatically choose based on coverage)
minsvlen-screen-ratio: 0.9 # minsvlen-screen-ratio N Minimum length for SV candidates (as fraction of --minsvlen) (default: 0.9)
mapq: 25 # mapq N Alignments with mapping quality lower than this value will be ignored (default: 25)
cluster-binsize: 100 # cluster-binsize N Initial screening bin size in bp (default: 100)


# SVIM specific
min_mapq: 20 # min_mapq MIN_MAPQ   Minimum mapping quality of reads to consider (default: 20). Reads with a lower mapping quality are ignored.

segment_overlap_tolerance: 5 # Maximum tolerated overlap between adjacent alignment (default: 5)
minimum_depth: 10 # minimum_depth MINIMUM_DEPTH Minimum total read depth for genotyping (default: 4). Variants covered by a total number of reads lower than this value are not assigned a genotype (./. in the output VCF file).
# POST-PROCESSING FILTERING
svim_quality: 10 # Minimum SV quality score in SVIM for filtering out the callset
svim_min_read_support: 10 # Minimum read support of 10 (similar to Sniffles) or 2 (sensitive filtering)

# DeBreak specific
# If you specify coverage of dataset with --depth, DeBreak will calculate min_support according to the table.
# min_support is the most important argument for SV filtering of DeBreak. It should be adjusted according to sequencing depth of input BAM. Without given min_support/depth information, DeBreak estimates the depth of input dataset to assign a resonable min_support.
# --min_quality MIN_QUALITY  minimal mapping quality of reads
# -m MIN_SUPPORT, --min_support MIN_SUPPORT minimal number of supporting reads for one event
# --rescue_dup          rescue DUP from INS calls. minimap2,ref required
# --rescue_large_ins    rescue large INS. wtdbg2,minimap2,ref required
# --poa                 POA for accurate breakpoint. wtdbg2,minimap2,ref required.
