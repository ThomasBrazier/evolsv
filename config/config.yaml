# CONFIG
# Directory setup
datadir: data/ # The directory where data and results must be stored

# SAMPLE
samples: config/samples.tsv # The sample files with sample name and SRA number of the long-read SRA archive
genome: GCA_947369205.1 # GCA/GCF number of the reference genome

# Mapping on the reference genome
minimap_ax: map-hifi # Preset for the sequencing technology (see Minimap2 manual)
minimap_seed: 42 # Integer seed for randomizing equally best hits. Minimap2 hashes INT and read name when choosing between equally best hits.

# SV calling
# Common settings
min_coverage: 10 # minimum of coverage for the SV callers
min_sv_size: 50 # minimum SV length to detect
max_sv_size: 100000 # maximum SV length to detect

# Sniffles2 specific
minsupport: "auto" #  Minimum number of supporting reads for a SV to be reported (default: automatically choose based on coverage)
minsvlen-screen-ratio: 0.9 # minsvlen-screen-ratio N Minimum length for SV candidates (as fraction of --minsvlen) (default: 0.9)
mapq: 25 # mapq N Alignments with mapping quality lower than this value will be ignored (default: 25)
cluster-binsize: 100 # cluster-binsize N Initial screening bin size in bp (default: 100)


# SVIM specific
min_mapq: 20 # min_mapq MIN_MAPQ   Minimum mapping quality of reads to consider (default: 20). Reads with a lower mapping quality are ignored.
segment_gap_tolerance: 10 #  Maximum tolerated gap between adjacent alignment segments (default: 10)
segment_overlap_tolerance: 5 # Maximum tolerated overlap between adjacent alignment (default: 5)
minimum_depth: 10 # minimum_depth MINIMUM_DEPTH Minimum total read depth for genotyping (default: 4). Variants covered by a total number of reads lower than this value are not assigned a genotype (./. in the output VCF file).
# POST-PROCESSING FILTERING
svim_quality: 10 # Minimum SV quality score in SVIM for filtering out the callset
svim_min_read_support: 10 # Minimum read support of 10 (similar to Sniffles) or 2 (sensitive filtering)


# CuteSV specific
max_cluster_bias_INS: 1000
diff_ratio_merging_INS: 0.9
max_cluster_bias_DEL: 1000
diff_ratio_merging_DEL: 0.5
max_size: -1
min_siglength: 10 # -sl MIN_SIGLENGTH, --min_siglength MIN_SIGLENGTH Minimum length of SV signal to be extracted.[10]



# DeBreak specific
# If you specify coverage of dataset with --depth, DeBreak will calculate min_support according to the table.
# min_support is the most important argument for SV filtering of DeBreak. It should be adjusted according to sequencing depth of input BAM. Without given min_support/depth information, DeBreak estimates the depth of input dataset to assign a resonable min_support.
# --min_quality MIN_QUALITY  minimal mapping quality of reads
# -m MIN_SUPPORT, --min_support MIN_SUPPORT minimal number of supporting reads for one event
# --rescue_dup          rescue DUP from INS calls. minimap2,ref required
# --rescue_large_ins    rescue large INS. wtdbg2,minimap2,ref required
# --poa                 POA for accurate breakpoint. wtdbg2,minimap2,ref required.

# Samplot Diagnostic plot
n_samplot: 1000 # The number of SVs randomly sampled to plot with Samplot

# Genotyping with SVJedi-graph
minsupport: 3 # Minimum number of alignments to genotype a SV (default: 3>=)

mappability_k: 150 #the kmer used to compute mappability with genmap; you should not need to change this except in special cases

#this ignores small regions of abberatant coverage/mappability as often these are just below the threshold
#to do strict filtering, set to 0
